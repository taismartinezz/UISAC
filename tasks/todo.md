# TODO

## Plan
- [x] Review existing Next.js starter structure and project instructions
- [x] Migrate single-page sections into separate routes
- [x] Implement Northwestern-style color palette and top navigation
- [x] Build individual pages: About, Mission and Statement, Calendar, Sponsor Acknowledgment, Tax Filing
- [ ] Run lint verification

## Review
- Implemented multi-page architecture with shared header navigation and route-based content pages.
- Updated visual system to Northwestern-inspired palette with a hero structure matching the provided example style.
- Verification still blocked in this shell because `npm` is unavailable (`command not found`).
